        <ul>
            <li>Tools/MapEditor and open index.html</li>
            <li>This is a simple app for creating maps to export as json for use by the component.</li>
            <li>You can add walls, 1/2 walls and 1/3 walls and toggle delete mode to delete walls you've added.</li>
            <li>Click the Export the map button to export the map you build.</li>
            <li>The map editor also includes several templates to start you off with generic sizes - 25 x 25, 50 x 50
            </li>
            <li>A future version will hopefully include the ability to create custom templates.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>IMPORTANT: Currently, all width and heights of maps need to be square so 25 x 25 and not 25 x 27 for
            example</strong>

        <header>Component Schema</header>
        <p>
            The modifiable schema - you can pass values and modify the following values -
            To add a custom map - add mapToLoad with the name of the JSON file containing the map data you exported
            before.
            You can add as many rooms as you want. This will load the map data and other metadata from the JSON,
            expecting the format as above
        </p>
        <pre>
                wallColor: {type: 'string', default: 'white'}, - color of walls
                floorColor: {type: 'string', default: 'white'}, - color of floors
                wallTexture: {type: 'string', default: 'none'}, - custum texture for wall full height
                wallTexture2: {type: 'string', default: 'none'}, - custum texture for 1/2 wall height
                wallTexture3: {type: 'string', default: 'none'}, custum texture for 1/3 wall height
                scale:{type: 'string', default: '1 1 1'}, - scale
                wallSize: {type:'string', default:'1'}, - wall sizing
                wallHeight: {type:'string', default:'3'}, - height of walls
                mapToLoad: {type:'string', default: 'map'}, - map to load - JSON file name
                indoor: {type:'boolean', default:false} - is the map indoor or outdoor?
